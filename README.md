The pandemic has affected many educational institutions, as a result, a lot of pupils were
unable, or in some cases still are, to go to in-person lessons. While that issue became more
evident during the pandemic, it has affected people from all over the world even before that
due to the lack of appropriate academic conditions to learn about programming in their close
proximity. Our solution to this issue comes in the form of an online environment designed
to teach programming to novices using robots over the internet.

Robots offer novices a more practical and palpable representation of what their code does
and being able to do it remotely through a web application would make that experience
available to all. The web application enables users to program a LEGO Mindstorms EV3
robot through wireless and provides the option to use a simulator if a robot is not available.
The project makes use of a domain-specific language to parse user friendly code into code
that the robot can execute. For implementation, the project uses a Robot-Server-Web Application
architecture to transmit code from the web application to the robot.
